# Agentic AI Engineering Course 🤖

This repository documents my journey and projects from "The Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course" on Udemy.

## 🌟 Live Demo
**Week 1 Project: Career Conversation Agent**
I deployed my first agent to Hugging Face! You can chat with it here:

**Week 02: Deep Research App- OpenAI SDK**
An autonomous research agent that performs deep-dives into complex topics, synthesizing information from multiple sources

**Week 03: Engineering Team (CrewAI)**
A multi-agent system built with CrewAI to simulate a high-performing engineering department.

**Week 04: AI Sidekick (LangGraph)**
A persistent, autonomous assistant utilizing an Evaluator-Worker loop to iteratively solve complex tasks using live web browsing, Python execution, and file management until strict success criteria are met.

**Week 05: Dynamic Meta-Agents (AutoGen)**
A self-expanding AI ecosystem where a master "Creator" agent dynamically writes Python code to generate unique, collaborative sub-agents on the fly over a scalable gRPC runtime.

**Week 06: Multi-Agent Trading Floor (MCP)**
An autonomous stock market simulation featuring four distinct LLM personas executing trades using real-time market data and portfolio management tools, fully decoupled using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
